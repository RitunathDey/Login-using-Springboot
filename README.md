# Login-using-Springboot
Implement a REST API solution which will return Success/ Failure message based on  the username &amp; password given in the login API body.
For instance: 
	If the /login API is hit through postman, provided the username & password in the body, 
	it will verify if the combination is true or not and return success/failure message.
